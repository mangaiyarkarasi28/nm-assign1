    Shri.N.V.Natarajan, the Chairman of Paavai Institutions, hails from Rasipuram in Namakkal District, Tamilnadu. His father, Shri. Varadappa Gounder, was an enterprising person working as Civil Engineering Contractor and running a sago factory of his own. His mother, Smt. Paavaiammal is a simple yet strong-willed and hard-working woman. No wonder, Shri.N.V.Natarajan has inherited the traits of sincerity, dedication and hard work from his parents.
